# Managing Environment Variables

Environment variables are essential for storing sensitive data like API keys securely.

### How to add Variables in Vercel:
1. Go to your project dashboard on Vercel.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Environment Variables**.
3. Add your **Key** and **Value** (e.g., `API_KEY = your_secret_key`).
4. Click **Save**.

Vercel will automatically use these variables during the next deployment.
