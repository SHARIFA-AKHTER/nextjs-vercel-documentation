# Creating a Next.js Application

The first step in our journey is to initialize a fresh Next.js project. We use the official CLI to ensure we have the latest features and configurations.

### Step 1: Run the Setup Command
Open your terminal and run the following command:
`npx create-next-app@latest my-awesome-app`

### Step 2: Select Configurations
During the setup, choose the following options for a modern stack:
* **TypeScript:** Yes (For type safety)
* **Tailwind CSS:** Yes (For styling)
* **App Router:** Yes (Recommended)

### Step 3: Local Preview
Once the installation is complete, navigate to the folder and start the dev server:
`cd my-awesome-app`
`npm run dev`

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your app running live locally.
